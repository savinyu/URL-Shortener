# URL-Shortener
This is my repo for the open project under ACM (IIT-R) -- URL-Shortener

This project is a URL shortener, which is designed to take long URLs and provide shortened, more manageable versions. 

This README file provides an overview of the project and its features.

**Features

  *Redirect users to the original long URL when they visit the shortened link.
  *Track the number of clicks on each shortened link.
  *Customizable URLs with vanity slugs.
  *Search functionality to find specific shortened links based on keywords.
  *User authentication and management for creating and managing shortened links. (Will Implement it soon).

**Dependencies
  1. Node.js
  2. Express.js
  3. MongoDB

  5. bcrypt (for password hashing)
